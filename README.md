#  Trees of Knowledge
## A mobile app for trees, by trees. ðŸŒ²

An iOS Mobile App made in SwiftUI, for studying and learning purposes. 
To run this project you need to use [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or any other alternative. 

In this project you have a list of elements, in which you can either add an element manually (by pressing the [Add Element] button), add a random element to it or use a specific link like, for example:

``` 
plantsofknowledge://plants?id=2231?name=palo_verde?imgUrl=sKjio0I?scientific_name=Parkinsonia_aculeata?wikipedia_entry=Parkinsonia_aculeata?desc='It_works_just_fine'
```

That opens the app and adds the specific element to the list.

**To-do List:**
- Clean most functions. 
- Add an option to erase all of the elements in the list
- Finish AddElement view
